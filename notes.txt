tag: identifies where the block in the line came from
block: data
word id width dictates how many columns in the block section there is

typically block id bits drive the tag

fully associative
store block ID as tag

replacement algorithm to toss out specific tags to make space for new ones

fifo algorithm: thing thats been in there the longest needs to be taken out

lru: least recently used: replace the block thats been least recently used

direct mapping: full address: tag | line ID | word
the bits in the line id correspond to the position in the cache
